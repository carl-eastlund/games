Power: Space Hot-Rodder, Level 5
Jack has basic training as a pilot, and has clocked many hours of practice in
unofficial drag races.

Shtick: Intimidating Countenance, Level 4
Jack is well over six feet and built like a brick wall.  Whether staring down
the enemy before a fight or questioning suspects in an interrogation room,
he is One Scary Guy.

Shtick: Handy-Man, Level 4
While Jack loves a fight above all else, in day-to-day ship operations there's
not much fighting to do.  So Jack also knows how to fix things.

Shtick: Security, Level 4
Obviously, with someone this tough, you want them on your security detail.
Knowing security procedures and systems helps Jack enforce the rules... and
occasionally bend them.

Shtick: Demolitions, Level 4
Can you believe it?  They let this guy handle explosives!

Complication, Major: Aggression and poor impulse control.
It's just how he is.  He won't obey direct orders, but in the absence of those
he'll try to take charge of any given situation and solve it via brute force.

Complication, Minor: low-level racism.
He's not a racist, but...  No offense, but...  I'm just sayin', is all.
